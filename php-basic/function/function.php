   In PHP, numeric, string, and date & time functions are categorized as built-in functions, also known as predefined functions. These functions are part of the core PHP language and are readily available for use without needing to be defined by the user. You can also create your own functions, which are called user-defined functions. 
Here's a breakdown:
Built-in Functions:
These are functions provided by PHP itself. They are pre-coded and ready to use for common tasks like string manipulation, number calculations, and date/time formatting. Examples include:
strlen() for string length.
number_format() for formatting numbers.
date() for date and time formatting. 
rand() for generating random numbers. 
User-defined Functions:
These are functions created by the programmer to perform specific tasks within a script. They are defined using the function keyword. 
Example: function myFunction($arg1, $arg2) { /* code to execute */ } 
Numeric Functions:
These functions handle numerical operations, such as calculating square roots, rounding numbers, or formatting numbers with separators. 
String Functions:
These functions manipulate strings, like finding the length of a string, converting case, or searching for substrings. 
Date & Time Functions:
These functions work with dates and times, such as formatting them, converting between formats, or calculating time differences.
